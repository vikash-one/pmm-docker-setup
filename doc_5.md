Create and place the files below (I'll give you the content again shortly).

### 3. 🚀 Push to GitHub

## 🔽 [Download Full Repo as ZIP](Optional)

If you'd like, I can generate a downloadable `.zip` of this structure — ready to extract and push.

---

## 📄 File Contents

Let me know if you'd like **all file contents bundled again** in one output (for `.env.example`, `docker-compose.*.yml`, `install`, `backup`, `Jenkinsfile`, and `README.md`) — I’ll paste them cleanly for direct use.

Would you like me to:

* Give you **all file contents now** (ready to copy)?
* Or generate a **GitHub repository template** for cloning directly?
